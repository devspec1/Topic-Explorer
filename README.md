# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Dev Notes

* Didn't use any other extra library except Github GraphQL API.

### How to run app & test

* After extract zip file, you need to open console and get into directory of root.
  And run below commands
  npm install
  npm start

#### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics 

* Code Structuring:
  This is very simple one component app, so nothing special in Code Structuring.
  Now App displays only first 10 related topics(And this is able to change).

* Refactoring:
  As I said in above section this is very simple so nothing special in Refactoring and this app is already fully optimized.

* Additional Features:
  Can extend features as github explorer.
  Now this App is just for Topic(name and stargazer count).
  Can change to full explorer including Users, Topics, Repositories, etc.
  And also some can make auto git management application liks SVN tortorise(Huge Extension).
