# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Dev Notes

* Used Github GraphQL API(https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

### How to run app & test

* Download by zip or use git clonse
* npm install
* npm start

#### Future Improvements

* Code Structuring:
  This is very simple one component app, so nothing special in Code Structuring.
  Now App displays only first 10 related topics(And this is able to change).

* Refactoring:
  As I said in above section this is very simple so nothing special in Refactoring and this app is already fully optimized.

* Additional Features:
  Can extend features as github explorer.
  Now this App is just for Topic(name and stargazer count).
  Can change to full explorer including Users, Topics, Repositories, etc.
  And also some can make auto git management application liks SVN tortorise(Huge Extension).
